The website will need to be completed by the end of the weekend. All of it.

#### Content

These are the **basic, essential** things that I want to include in my website:

- Links to my stuff online (art insta, youtube channel, github, social media)
- Contact information (email address)
- A blog
- About me (maybe combine with short, bullet point version)

That's all for the basics, that's the stuff I want to have **uploaded and running** by Monday.

These are the extras that I would like to have on the site with time:

- A mailing list
- A book club link
- A list of recommended reading

#### Styles

I would like the site to be B&W and as minimalistic as possible, but still be pretty. 

###### Index

My name at the top of the screen, a small, changing phrase in italics right below like a slogan. Under the slogan there's a navigation bar like the one on http://andrevv.com/. It is populated with the sections of the site. Under this there's space until the bottom of the browser, filled with a background and a video of me saying hi that plays if you hit a certain button, maybe like the one here https://jefflombard.com/. At the bottom of the site there's a phrase saying "made with love in Valencia, Spain by Enrique Tasa. December 2018.".

###### Other sections

The same navbar as the one in index is at the top of the screen. The same phrase is at the bottom of the site. The space in between is to be filled with whatever the section holds. TBD.
