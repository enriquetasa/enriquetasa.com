### about

- I was born in 1997 in Valencia, Spain. I was lucky to speak both Valenciano (Catalan) and Spanish natively. There I still have my family and a good bunch of friends.
- I liked tech, so I moved to the UK and studied Electronic Engineering at University of Manchester. There I perfected my English and learnt a couple programming languages.
- I was an active alumni of the European Youth Parliament for 5 years. I spoke at conferences and debated European policy and generally had fun. For some time, I was the president of EYP Espa√±a. There I learnt public speaking and the importance of listening.
- I worked at Alfatec Sistemas for a year, learning what software engineers do and writing C# code for companies like Mercedes Benz. There I realised loved software and that that's what I wanted to do professionally.
- I draw and paint and upload my work to instagram. There I share my visual ideas and I express myself.
- I sometimes have something to say and I film it and upload it to my Youtube channel. There I exchange ideas and find inspiration.
- I love to read. You can find some of my favourite books and recommendations here.
