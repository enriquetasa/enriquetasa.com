    <div id="about">
      <p class="aboutText">I was born in 1997 in Valencia, Spain. I was lucky to speak both Valenciano and Spanish natively.</p> 
      <p class="aboutText">There I still have my family and a good bunch of friends.</p>
      <p class="aboutText">I liked tech, so I moved to the UK and studied Electronic Engineering at University of Manchester.</p>
      <p class="aboutText">There I perfected my English and learnt a couple programming languages.</p>
      <p class="aboutText">I was an active alumni of the European Youth Parliament for 5 years. I spoke at conferences and debated European policy and generally had fun. For some time, I was the president of EYP Espa√±a.</p> 
      <p class="aboutText">There I learnt public speaking and the importance listening.</p>
      <p class="aboutText">I worked at Alfatec Sistemas for a year, learning what software engineers do and writing C# code for companies like Mercedes Benz.</p>
      <p class="aboutText">There I realised loved software and that that's what I wanted to do professionally.</p>
      <p class="aboutText">I draw and paint and upload my work to instagram.</p> 
      <p class="aboutText">There I share my visual ideas and express myself.</p>
      <p class="aboutText">I sometimes have something to say and I film it and upload it to my Youtube channel.</p>
