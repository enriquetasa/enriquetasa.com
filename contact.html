    <p>Hi, I’m Tasa.</p>
    
    <p>I was born in 1997 in what subjectively is the best city in the world (that would be Valencia, Spain) and since then   I’ve been trying to figure out what to do with my life. I’ve not had much progress on finding an exact answer yet, but on   my search for one I’ve found some things I really enjoy doing.</p>
    
    <p>This site is a hub for me to keep track of those things, and shout them out to the vast, scary void of the social  internet, in the hopes that someone out there will find them interesting. Its also a place where I just ramble and keep  track of my thoughts, and it just serves as a space online where I can really do whatever.</p>
